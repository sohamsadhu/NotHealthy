This repository contains two Java files, besides this one.

The main program NotHealthy.java is a program that displays a producer consumer problem. It is a
problem, that solves concurrency issues by use of threads. The producer is an Agent class that has
three supplies tobacco, matches, and paper. The Agent puts two of those items on table at a time
and goes to sleep for a second. For making a cigarette, all the three aforementioned items are 
required. There are three smokers, initially all having a different single item for making a cigarette.
Once a smoker, gets all the items for a cigarette, then s/he smokes and goes to sleep for a second.

There is another program of matrix multiplication thrown in. It is an example to display how to
use threads for parallelism.
